# Athanasius
Creative Delta Robot and 3D printer.

Athanasius is a delta robot with various functions. Many components are derivitive of Athena and other Rep-Raps. Athanasius is refined for increased creative potential which may be of value to artists, designers, and architects, as well as makers and engineers.

Default Firmware is Franklin by Bas Wijnen. It can be run, although not as well, on Marlin. Other firmware, such as smoothie would be possible too.  

Based primarily upon Athena by MTU-MOST.
